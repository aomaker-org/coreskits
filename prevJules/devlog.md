## Step 1: Task Setup and Directory Creation

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-08-21 14:39:42.964242
*   **Status:** Complete

### Prompt

> My intent was misunderstood. The branch does not have the necessary files to run doit, etc.

### Jules's Thought Process

The user has indicated that my previous submission was incorrect because it was an incomplete, isolated fix. My goal now is to create a new branch `523` that contains the *entire*, working development environment. I will start by resetting the environment to ensure a clean slate, and then create all the necessary files in one go.

### Jules's Response

> My apologies. I misunderstood your intent. In my attempt to create a clean, isolated fix for the `Dockerfile` URL, I see now that I failed to deliver the complete, working environment you wanted on the new branch. My goal was to follow best practices by not bundling unrelated changes, but I see that this was not what you needed in this context.

> I will start over on a new branch, `523`, and create the entire development environment in a single, coherent commit. This will include the corrected `Dockerfile`, the `dodo.py` script, the CI workflow, and all the documentation, so that the branch is self-contained and functional.
>
> I will begin this process now.

## Step 2: Create Project Files

### Jules's Thought Process

I will now create all the project files in a single, logical sequence. I will start with the `Dockerfile`, then the `requirements.txt` and `dodo.py`, then the CI/CD workflow, and finally the documentation. I will log each file creation as a separate action within this step.

### Action 2.3: Create `dodo.py`

### Action 2.4: Create CI/CD Directory
